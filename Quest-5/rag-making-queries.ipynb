An Active Rider is identified bya\\n unique phone number. If a rider has two mobile phone numbers or changed their phone number and such rider took rides using both phone numbers during the quarter,that person would count\\n as two Active Riders. If a rider has a personal and business profile tied to the same mobile phone number, that person would be considered a singleActive Rider. If a ride has been requested by an\\n organization using our Concierge offering for the benefit of a rider, we exclude this rider in the calculation of Active Ridersunless the ride is access\\nible in the Lyft App. Revenue per Active Rider is calculated by dividing revenue for a period by Active Riders for the same period.Beginning\\n in the fourth quarter of 2020, some riders were able to access their Concierge rides in the Lyft App if they already had a Lyft account. Accordingly,Lyft\\n updated the definition of Active Riders to include Concierge riders if the rider’s phone number matches that of a verified Lyft account, allowing the rider to accesstheir\\n ride in the Lyft App. This update resulted in a 0.01% increase, or an additional 927 Active Riders in the fourth quarter of 2020. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2020, allConcierge riders were exc\\nluded from the calculation of Active Riders as Concierge rides could not be matched with verified rider accounts.With\\n the exception of the three months ended March 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended March 31, 2020, Active Riders in each of the three monthperiods\\n ended  June  30,  September  30,  and  December  31,  2021  increased  compared  to  the  same  period  in  2020  as  vaccines  were  more  widely  distributed  and  morecommunities\\n fully reopened. Active Riders in the three months periods ended June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2020 represented significantly lower Active Ridercounts\\n since shelter-in-place orders and other travel restrictions were first implemented across North America in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020. Theslight decrease in the number of Active Riders in the three months ended \\nDecember 31, 2021 as compared to the three months ended September 30, 2021 was due primarilyto the increasing COVID-19 case counts \\nfrom COVID-19 variants and their impact on demand as well as the seasonality we typically experience in the winter months.Revenue per Active Rider increased in each of the three months period\\ns ended March 31, June 30, September 30, and December 31, 2021 as compared to the sameperiods\\n in  2020,  primarily  reflecting  the  improvement  in  demand  on  our  platform  compared  to  earlier  periods  during  the  COVID-19  pandemic,  which  had  materiallylimited\\n people's mobility and severely reduced Active Riders. Revenue per Active Rider reached an all-time high in the three months ended December 31, 2021, increasingcompared\\n to the three months ended September 30, 2021. This was driven by an increase in ride frequency as well as a shift toward higher revenue rides such as airportrides,\\n reflecting the increased travel experienced in the fourth quarter in 2021 nationwide. Revenue per Active Rider also benefited from revenues from licensing and dataaccess agreements, beg\\ninning in the second quarter of 2021.Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\\nOur\\n consolidated  financial  statements  and  the  related  notes  thereto  included  elsewhere  in  this  Annual  Report  on  Form  10-K  are  prepared  in  accordance  withGAAP.\", start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=3934, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8825758099555969),\n",

BUSINESS\\nOverview\\nUber\\n Technologies, Inc. (“Uber,” “we,” “our,” or “us”) is a technology platform that uses a massive network, leading technology, operational excellence andproduct\\n expertise to power movement from point A to point B. We develop and operate proprietary technology applications supporting a variety of offerings onour\\n platform  (“platform(s)”  or  “Platform(s)”).  We  connect  consumers  (“Rider(s)”)  with  independent  providers  of  ride  services  (“Mobility  Driver(s)”)  forridesharing\\n services,  and  connect  Riders  and  other  consumers  (“Eater(s)”)  with  restaurants,  grocers  and  other  stores  (collectively,  “Merchants”)  with  deliveryservice\\n providers  (“Couriers”)  for  meal  preparation,  grocery  and  other  delivery  services.  Riders  and  Eaters  are  collectively  referred  to  as  “end-user(s)”  or“consumer(s).”\\n Mobility Drivers and Couriers are collectively referred to as “Driver(s).” We also connect consumers with public transportation networks. We usethis same network, technology, ope\\nrational excellence and product expertise to connect shippers with carriers in the freight industry.Our\\n technology is available in approximately 72 countries around the world, principally in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada, Latin America, Europe, theMiddle East, Africa, and Asia (\\nexcluding China and Southeast Asia).Our Segments\\nAs\\n of December 31, 2021, we had three operating and reportable segments: Mobility, Delivery and Freight. Mobility, Delivery and Freight platform offeringseach address large, fr\\nagmented markets.Mobility\\nMobility\\n refers to products that connect consumers with Mobility Drivers who provide rides in a variety of vehicles, such as cars, auto rickshaws, motorbikes,minibuses, or taxis. Mobility \\nalso includes activity related to our financial partnerships offerings.We\\n believe that our ridesharing category position is a key indicator of our progress towards our massive market opportunity. We calculate our ridesharingcategory\\n position based on the best available data within a given region. For example, in most cases we divide our Mobility Gross Bookings by our estimates oftotal\\n ridesharing Gross Bookings generated by us and other companies with similar ridesharing products. We estimate our total ridesharing Gross Bookings in agiven\\n region by utilizing internal source data, including historical trip, bookings, product mix, and fare information, and external source data provided by publiclyavailable information and marketing analytics\\n firms. Based on these estimates, we believe we have a leading ridesharing category position in every major region ofthe\\n world  where  we  operate.  We  also  participate  in  certain  regions  through  our  minority-owned  affiliates.  At  the  time  of  entering  into  such  transactions,  webelieved\\n based on our internal estimates using the information then available to us that each of Didi, Grab and Yandex.Taxi, on a pro forma basis, had the leadingridesharing category po\\nsition in its respective market.Delivery\\nOur\\n Delivery  offering  allows  consumers  to  search  for  and  discover  local  restaurants,  order  a  meal,  and  either  pick-up  at  the  restaurant  or  have  the  mealdelivered\\n and, in certain markets, Delivery also includes offerings for grocery, alcohol and convenience store delivery as well as select other goods. We launchedour\\n Delivery app over six years ago. We believe that Delivery not only leverages, but also increases, the supply of Drivers on our network. For example, Deliveryenables\\n Mobility Drivers to increase their utilization and earnings by accessing additional demand for trips during non-peak Mobility times. Delivery also expandsthe\\n pool of Drivers by enabling people who are not Mobility Drivers or who do not have access to Mobility-qualified vehicles to provide delivery services on ourplatform. In addition to b\\nenefiting Drivers and consumers, Delivery provides Merchants with an instant mobile presence and efficient delivery capability, which webelieve\\n generates incremental demand and improves margins for Merchants by enabling them to serve more consumers without increasing their existing front-of-house expenses.\\nDuring\\n 2021, we completed the acquisition of the remaining 45% ownership interest in Cornershop Cayman (“Cornershop”) in an all-stock transaction. Theacquisition\\n was accounted for as an equity transaction, as we previously controlled and consolidated Cornershop.', start_char_idx=0, end_char_idx=4495, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'), score=0.8564815521240234)],\n",
